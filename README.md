## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- A Google Colab Pro account with an A100 GPU is required, so you need to add credit to your Google Colab account.
- Please download your Token, which is related to Food101, the dataset from the Kaggle site, and import it into the code to have permission to use the mentioned dataset.
